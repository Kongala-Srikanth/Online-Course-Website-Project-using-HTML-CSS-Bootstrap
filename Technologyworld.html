								When you’re looking for a job or exploring a new career path, it’s smart to go out on informational interviews. 
								But what should you say when you’re actually in one? Which questions will help you gain the most information? 
								Are there any topics you should avoid? And how should you ask for more help if you need it?
							</p>

					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">What the Experts Say</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						“Informational interviews are essential to helping you find out more about the type of industry, company, or role you’re interested in,” says Dorie Clark, author of Stand Out Networking. 
						“You may think you already know all about a certain position, but speaking to someone directly gives you the opportunity to test your assumptions.” John Lees, a UK-based career strategist and author of The Success Code, agrees. 
						Informational interviews “give you exposure — a way to get yourself known in the hidden job market,” he says. “The visibility may put you straight onto a short list, even if a job isn’t advertised.” 
						They can also be a great boost to your self-esteem. “You get to wear smart business clothes and visit places of work, which maintains your confidence levels in a job search,” he explains. 
						So whether you’re actively trying to change roles or just exploring different professional paths, here are some tips on how to make the most of an informational interview.
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Prepare and practice</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						Informational interviews are, according to Clark, “a safe environment to ask questions.” But that doesn’t mean you should go in cold. After all, your goal is to come across in a way that inspires others to help you. 
						So do your homework. Study up on industry lingo. Learn who the biggest players are. Be able to talk about the most important trends. You don’t want to waste your expert’s time asking Google-able questions. 
						“You will come across as a more serious candidate if you are familiar with the jargon and vocabulary,” says Clark. Lees concurs. “Showing that you’ve done your background research plants the idea of credibility in the other person’s mind,” he says. 
						Work on your listening and conversation skills too. Lees suggests that you practice “asking great questions and conveying memorable energy” with “people who are easy to talk to, such as your family, your friends, and friends of friends.”
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Keep your introduction short</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						“What frustrates busy people is when they agree to an informational interview, and then the person seeking advice spends 15 minutes talking about himself and his job search” instead of learning from them, says Lees. It’s not a venue to practice your elevator pitch; 
						it’s a place to “absorb information and find stuff out.” Clark suggests preparing a “brief, succinct explanation about yourself” that you can recite in three minutes max: “Here’s my background, here’s what I’m thinking, and I’d like your feedback.” People can’t help you unless 
						they understand what you’re looking for, but this part of the conversation should be brief.
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Set the tone</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						“You want to leave people with a positive impression and enough information to recommend you to others,” says Lees. At the beginning of the interview, establish your relationship by revisiting how you were connected in the first place. “Ideally, 
						this person has been warmly introduced to you” — perhaps you have a friend or colleague in common or you share an alma mater — so remind them, he says. It’s also a good idea to state at the outset that “you’re interested in talking to 10 or 15 industry experts” 
						during your information-gathering phase. “That way, the person will start to process the fact that you are looking for additional sources early on. If you wait until the end to ask for other referrals, she might be caught off guard.” Ask about time constraints up front too, says Clark. 
						“If, at the end of the time allotted, you’re having a good conversation, say, ‘I want to respect your time. I would love to keep talking, but if you need to go, I understand.’ Prove you’re a person of your word.”
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Think like a journalist</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						Prepare a list of informed, intelligent questions ahead of time, says Clark. “You don’t necessarily need to stick to the script, but if you’re unfocused and you haven’t planned, you risk offending the person. Lees recommends approaching your interview like “an investigative journalist would.” 
						You’re not cross-examining your expert, and you certainly don’t want to come across as “pushy or difficult,” but you should “gently probe through curiosity, then listen.” He suggests a framework of five questions along the lines of Daniel Porot’s “Pie Method”:

							<h1 class="interview-main-heading">Phone Interview Questions to Ask Job Candidates in First Round</h1>
							<p class="interview-paragraph">
								As a hiring manager, you know what a good resume and cover letter look like. You also know that despite their promises, they might fail to deliver the candidate you need. 
								The phone interview questions you ask during this first round of vetting will be a critical piece of winnowing the field and making a successful hire.
								Time always matters, so you should be both efficient and strategic during this initial call. Questions for a screening interview will touch on whether a candidate's hard skills, experience, 
								education and certifications are right for the open position. But as you check off the boxes, pay attention to soft skills and how the candidate presents during the call. At the end of a phone screen interview, 
								you want to be confident a candidate can do the job and also mesh well with your organizational culture.
								Open-ended or technical questions aren’t necessary at this stage of the hiring process. A screening interview is typically a 15- to 30-minute phone call. Your objective here is to narrow your 
								list of top candidates to the handful you want to consider for formal interviews. That’s when you can go deep.
								Read on for some tips for what to look for — including red flags — along with phone interview questions to ask during this first call, and what comes next.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Planning for the phone screening</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						As you would for any business conversation, you want to practice good etiquette when scheduling and conducting a phone screen interview. Respect the interviewee’s time by keeping to the schedule. 
						Respect their availability for the phone call, too. Candidates who are working, even if it's from home, may not be able to talk until after business hours.
						Approach every conversation with a blank slate, and treat each candidate fairly and equally. Remain fully engaged during every call. All that can be easier said than done: When you conduct one phone screen 
						interview after another, it’s easy to race through the questions you ask each person. If that sounds like you, refrain from stacking up the calls back-to-back. And set aside a time and a location where you can 
						conduct the screening interview free of noise or other distractions.
						Remember, you’re engaging with an external audience. A professional, thoughtful screening interview will enhance your business reputation; a hurried process and a gruff manner won’t reflect well on you or your firm. 
						Keep in mind that your top candidates are evaluating you as closely as you are them. Some might decline an invitation to a formal interview if they’re at all uncomfortable during this initial contact.
						Finally, once you settle on your shortlist, review the resumes once more before scheduling the calls. Then create a list of phone interview questions to ask so you can be consistent with what you ask each interviewee.
						 You want to make a fair comparison of the talent when deciding which candidates you’d like to advance to the next stage.
						Good phone interview questions
						Tailor the phone interview questions below to suit your industry and the role you’re hiring for. But consider, too, the candidate’s professional history, or lack thereof. Recent college graduates can’t refer to their career successes, 
						for example, but screening questions can be framed to allow candidates to draw on their experience in course seminars and team projects, as well as their volunteer work and self-taught skills. Leadership, drive, industriousness, talent and other valued qualities can be demonstrated in many ways.
						Give the same consideration for candidates with a gap in their work history, such as a parent reentering the workforce after raising a couple of kids, or an out-of-work professional two months after a layoff. Follow this list of five phone interview tips:

							<h1 class="interview-main-heading">Individual Interviews</h1>
							<p class="interview-paragraph">
								In individual interviews, an interviewer talks with one user for 30 minutes to an hour. Individual interviews allow you to probe their attitudes, beliefs, desires, and experiences to get a deeper understanding 
								of the users who come to your site. You can also ask them to rate or rank choices for site content.  These interviews can take place face-to-face, by phone or video conference, or via instant messaging system.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">When to Conduct Individual Interviews</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						Ideally, interviews take place at the start of the development cycle while you are developing or reviewing the objectives and goals of the site.
						You may also use interviews to supplement online surveys. Performing an interview before a survey helps you to refine questions for the survey.  
						Interviewing participants after a survey allows you to probe for details and reasons behind answers that users give on a survey
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">Best Practices for Conducting Individual Interviews</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						When you conduct an Individual Interview, consider:
						<ul>
							<li>What you want to learn and then selecting representative participants to talk to</li>
							<li>Writing an interview protocol for the interviewer to follow. The protocol includes questions and probes to use for follow-up</li>
							<li>Hiring a skilled interviewer who knows how to make interviewees feel more comfortable, asks questions in a neutral manner, listens well, and knows when and how to probe for more details</li>
							<li>Getting permission to tape the sessions and have one or more note takers</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">How Individual Interviews Differ from Other Methods</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						Since these interviews do not involve watching a user work, they are different from interviewing users in a usability test or conducting contextual interviews.
						Individual interviews resemble focus groups because they involve talking with users but they differ for because in individual interviews you:
						<ul>
							<li>Talk to only one person at a time</li>
							<li>Have more time to discuss topics in detail</li>
							<li>Do not have to worry about the group dynamics that inevitably occur in focus groups</li>
							<li>Can give the interviewee your full attention and adjust your interviewing style to your interviewee’s needs</li>

							<h1 class="interview-main-heading">Group Interview</h1>
							<p class="interview-paragraph">
								Group interview refers to a type of interview where more than two people are involved. It can mean that a number of candidates are interviewed together at the same time (known as candidate 
								group interview) or that one candidate is interviewed by more different department representatives at the same time (known as panel group interview).
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">How to conduct a group interview</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Inform the candidates: group interviews should never be a surprise to candidates. Therefore, when you request an interview with candidates you should also inform them that the respective interview will utilize 
								a group format. This avoids surprises and affords candidates the opportunity to prepare specifically for the group format.
							</li>
							<li>
								Meet with other interviewers beforehand: members of the interview team must be on the same page regarding how the interview will be conducted. Which questions, who will ask them, how candidates will be evaluated, etc. should all be sorted out before the group interview takes place.
							</li>
							<li>
								Introduce yourselves: given that, in the panel format, candidates will interview with multiple employees, each member of the interview panel should introduce themselves, identify their role in the organization, and explain why they are part of the interview panel. This should occur, moreover, as soon as candidates arrive for their interview.
							</li>
							<li>
								Take turns asking questions: not only should members of a panel take turns asking questions, you should determine the order of questions, and who will ask them, beforehand. This will help ensure candidates are not overwhelmed by the group and are able to focus on the question at hand.
							</li>
							<li>
								Debrief with the rest of the panel: After the interview concludes, the panel should take time to share their general impressions of candidates. This debrief, moreover, should occur as soon as possible in order to ensure thoughts and impressions are fresh in the panel’s minds.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h1 class="interview-sub-heading">How to succeed in a group interview</h1>
					<p class="interview-paragraph">
						There are endless tips on how to nail a group interview. Here are some of what we think are the most helpful:
						<ul>
							<li>Do your research beforehand: you should be familiar with the organization, the role you are interviewing for, and members of the hiring team before you arrive. Being prepared and informed is an essential quality for prospective employees.</li>
							<li>Greet both the interview panel and your fellow candidates individually: this demonstrates strong people skills and provides you with everyone’s name, which you can reference later in the interview.</li>
							<li>Prepare your introduction: group interviews will typically begin by asking candidates to introduce themselves. While this might seem like a harmless questions, it's actually the first opportunity to distinguish yourself from the other candidates. You should therefore
								 write out and memorize a short introduction that succinctly outlines your background, experience, and why you’re perfect for the job at hand.</li>
							<li>Support some of your co-interviewers statements and involve the entire room: you are, of course, trying to distinguish yourself as the best candidate for the position. However, doing so does not require you to answer each question differently than your co-interviewees. Instead, with questions that you have similar answers to than the other candidates, 
								don’t be afraid to agree with, but expand upon or add complexity and detail to what’s already been said. Say something like “I think (name) is correct, (their answer) is important. What I’d add to that is x, y, and z.”</li>
